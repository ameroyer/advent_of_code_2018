# Advent of Code 2018

My Python solution to Advent of Code 2018. Each day is in a separate notebook for easy vizualisation. [More information about the challenge here](https://adventofcode.com/2018)

> **Advent of Code** is an Advent calendar of **small programming puzzles** for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. 
People use them as a speed contest, interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, or to challenge each other
